# Schotter

**Schotter** will generate line art inspired by [Georg Nees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Nees)' graphic
[*Gravel*](https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O221321/schotter-print-nees-georg/) (*Schotter* in German). The
resulting SVG images can be used to drive a plotter &mdash; such as [Evil Mad Scientist's
AxiDraw](https://axidraw.com) &mdash; to create beautiful pieces of art.
